### 3. Random Quote Machine

The project I considered to be the "first". I wasn't going to bother searching
quotes I liked because then I'd be upset if I didn't include *every* good thing
I've *ever read*. The result was a random chapter selector from the Tao Te Ching
. Something I'm proud to share and incorporate in my life; rather than being a
throwaway project. (Except for that one passage about infants; it's weird.)
