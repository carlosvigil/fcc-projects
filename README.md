## Various projects from the FreeCodeCamp curriculum

### 1. Tribute Page

A page commemorating someone or something that inspires you. I first chose to make it about nonsense. It was quick and simply checked off the curriculum boxes. I didn't know if I would come back to it but I did, and this time I made it an actual tribute to a deceased pet of our family. This one came out a lot better and more thought was put into it.

### 2. Personal Portfolio (carlosvigil.me)

This project evolved and morphed a few times as I already had a personal website . It was plain HTML with a little bit of CSS. I made the FCC project using bootstrap, which I thought was bloated. I didn't like how it clashed with the minimalism of my live site. Eventually, I decided that it would be best to show the codepen/bootstrap site live. I figured since it's already on most browsers computers it wouldn't actually be a hassle. I would still like to use a tool like UnCSS to lighten the load. That site is currently going through a third redesign as I learn new tools, practices, and techniques.

### 3. Random Quote Machine

The project I considered to be the "first". I wasn't going to bother searching quotes I liked because then I'd be upset if I didn't include *every* good thing I've *ever* read. The result was a random chapter selector from the Tao Te Ching . Something I'm proud to share and incorporate in my life; rather than being a throwaway project. (Except for that one passage about infants; it's weird). Note: 2023, looks like some number of people have copied my project and code since 2016.

### 4. Local Weather App

Build an app that shows the local weather and allows the user to change degree
scale. I made it in less than a day; it shows. Most notably, I didn't make use
of the API's ability to return Centigrade and Fahrenheit but made some messy
functions for converting the data. And, it can only be done once, from ºF to ºC.
 I remember the distinct feeling of disgust when I decided the required stories
were met.

### 5. Wikipedia Viewer

Started, returned to weather app. Not sure when I'll get back to it as I'm either in
class, work, or doing homework.
